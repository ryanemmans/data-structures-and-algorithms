- Arguments: string
- Return: string

## Inputs / Outputs

| `"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom..."`                                              	| `"it"`     	|

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

- First we need to split a string into an array of words, using RegEx to take punctuation into account.
- We will then store this array of words in a hashmap as a Set using `toLowerCase()`.
- We will iterate through the array using a for loop, checking if the word is already in the map.
- If so, return the word, otherwise add the word to the map
- Return null if no words repeat.
- This will have an O(n) in both time and space.
