# Linked List `k`'th

## Problem Domain

Node: Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

Linked List: Create a Linked List class. Within your Linked List class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

The class should contain the following methods:

- kth from end
  - argument: a number, `k`, as a parameter.
  - Return the nodeâ€™s value that is `k` places from the tail of the linked list.

## Inputs / Outputs

`ll.kthFromEnd(k)`

| Input `ll`                              	| Arg `k` 	| Output      	|
|-----------------------------------------	|---------	|-------------	|
| `head -> [1] -> [3] -> [8] -> [2] -> X` 	| `0`     	| `2`         	|
| `head -> [1] -> [3] -> [8] -> [2] -> X` 	| `2`     	| `3`         	|
| `head -> [1] -> [3] -> [8] -> [2] -> X` 	| `6`     	| `Exception` 	|

## Whiteboard Process

## Algorithm

Create a Node class with a constructor with properties for the value and next.

Create a LinkedList class with a constructor with a property for the head. Create the following methods:

`ll.kthFromEnd(k)`
